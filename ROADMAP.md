**What we have:** All core domain logic, event sourcing, CI pipeline, deployable HTTP API with auth + multi-tenancy + observability. Tamper-evident hash chain, witness retry, startup integrity check, auditor export APIs, performance benchmarks. Docker Compose for full-stack deployment. External verification network, public verification API, Merkle inclusion proofs, SOC 2 + ISO 27001 compliance evidence, typed SDK, SLA enforcement, multi-tenant governance hardening.

**What we don't have:** Rehydration (fromEvents), end-to-end pipeline orchestration, or user-facing UIs.

---

## Phase 6 — Hardening

**Goal:** Make the existing codebase production-grade without adding new features.

### 6.1 — JSON Canonicalization (RFC 8785)

Replace the hand-rolled `sortKeys` canonicalization in `@attestia/witness` with RFC 8785 (JCS) compliant serialization. Content-addressed systems live or die by deterministic serialization.

- [ ] Implement or adopt RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: unicode normalization, IEEE 754 number formatting, nested arrays
- [ ] Add property-based tests (fast-check) to verify determinism across inputs
- [ ] Apply to both `@attestia/witness` payload hashing and `@attestia/registrum` attestation

### 6.2 — `@attestia/types` Tests

The only package with zero tests. Types are compile-time checked, but the type guards, factories, and utility functions (`parseAmount`, `zeroMoney` re-exports, event metadata builders) need runtime test coverage.

- [ ] Add type guard tests (narrowing, edge cases)
- [ ] Add factory function tests
- [ ] Target: 30+ tests

### 6.3 — CI Pipeline

No CI exists. Every commit should prove the system is green.

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow: `pnpm install → build → test` on push + PR
- [x] Matrix: Node 20 + Node 22
- [ ] Coverage reporting (aim: ≥95% on registrum, ledger; ≥90% elsewhere)
- [ ] Lint pass (biome or eslint — pick one, enforce consistently)
- [x] Type-check pass (`tsc --noEmit` across all packages)

### 6.5 — Docker-Based XRPL Integration Testing

Use `rippleci/rippled` in standalone mode for deterministic, offline XRPL integration tests. No testnet dependency, no faucet, sub-second ledger close via `ledger_accept`.

- [x] Docker Compose with standalone `rippled` (WebSocket on port 6006, admin RPC on port 5005)
- [x] Integration test suite: submit attestation → close ledger → fetch → verify round-trip
- [x] Tests skip gracefully when Docker/rippled unavailable (CI-optional)
- [ ] Add rippled service to GitHub Actions CI pipeline

### 6.4 — Property-Based Testing

The current test suite is example-based. Financial systems need invariant testing.

- [ ] Add fast-check to registrum (invariants hold for arbitrary transitions)
- [ ] Add fast-check to ledger (trial balance always balances, no negative-amount creation)
- [ ] Add fast-check to reconciler (matching is commutative, deterministic)
- [ ] Add fast-check to witness (canonicalize is idempotent, hash is deterministic)

---

## Phase 7 — Persistence & Event Sourcing

**Goal:** Make state durable and replayable. Currently everything lives in-memory and vanishes on process restart.

### 7.1 — `@attestia/event-store`

A new package for append-only event persistence.

- [x] Define `EventStore` interface: `append(event)`, `read(streamId, fromVersion?)`, `subscribe(streamId)`
- [x] In-memory implementation (for tests — replace raw arrays in vault/treasury/reconciler)
- [x] File-based implementation (JSONL — one event per line, crash-safe via fsync)
- [ ] Optional: SQLite implementation (single-file, zero-config, good for desktop/server)
- [x] Snapshot support: `SnapshotStore` interface + InMemory + File implementations

### 7.2 — Rehydration

Each package's state machines need to rebuild from events.

- [ ] `Vault.fromEvents(events[])` — reconstruct portfolio, budgets, intents
- [ ] `Treasury.fromEvents(events[])` — reconstruct payroll runs, distributions, gates
- [ ] `Reconciler.fromEvents(events[])` — reconstruct reports and attestation records
- [ ] `XrplWitness.fromEvents(events[])` — reconstruct witness record index
- [ ] Registrum already has `rehydrate()` — verify it works with the event store interface

### 7.3 — Event Catalog

- [x] Formalize all domain events across packages into a unified catalog (20 event types)
- [x] Schema versioning strategy (so old events remain readable after code changes)
- [x] Event migration support (transform v1 events to v2 shape via chained migrations)

---

## Phase 8 — Service Layer, API Surface & Operator Tooling ✅

**Goal:** Expose a deployable Attestia node with stable v1 REST API, auth, multi-tenancy, and observability.

### 8.1 — API Contract & Types

- [x] Error envelope format: `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`
- [x] Cursor-based pagination: `{ data, pagination: { cursor, hasMore } }`
- [x] URL-path versioning strategy (`/api/v1/`)

### 8.2 — `@attestia/node` Service Layer
- [x] `AttestiaService` composition root wiring all 10 domain packages
- [x] `TenantRegistry` for isolated multi-tenant service instances

### 8.3 — Core API Endpoints (17 endpoints)
- [x] Intent lifecycle: declare, list, get, approve, reject, execute, verify

- [x] Verification: replay-based and hash-based
- [x] Reconciliation: reconcile + attest + list attestations
- [x] Health: `/health` + `/ready`
- [x] Metrics: `/metrics` (Prometheus text)

### 8.4 — Auth, Tenancy, Rate Limiting
- [x] API-key auth via `X-Api-Key` header
- [x] JWT bearer auth via `Authorization: Bearer` (HMAC-SHA256)
- [x] Role-based permission guards (admin > operator > viewer)
- [x] Token-bucket rate limiter per identity (429 + Retry-After)
- [x] Auth-derived tenant isolation

### 8.5 — Idempotency & Concurrency
- [x] `Idempotency-Key` header with TTL-based in-memory cache
- [x] ETag generation for intent state (SHA-256)

### 8.6 — Observability
- [x] Hand-rolled Prometheus metrics (counters + histograms)
- [x] Structured request logging via pino
- [x] X-Request-Id propagation

### 8.7 — Docker & Deployment
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile (node:22-slim)
- [x] Docker Compose: attestia-node + rippled
- [x] Env-based configuration via Zod schema
- [x] Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT)

### 8.8 — Documentation
- [x] curl examples for full lifecycle
- [x] API versioning strategy document

## Phase 13 — Advisory Intelligence

**Goal:** AI advises, humans decide. AI never approves, signs, or executes.

### 13.1 — Anomaly Detection

- [ ] Statistical analysis on reconciliation history (drift detection, outlier flagging)
- [ ] Alert when a transaction pattern deviates from historical norms
- [ ] No auto-remediation — surface findings to human operators

### 13.2 — Intent Suggestion

- [ ] Based on recurring patterns (e.g., monthly payroll), suggest pre-built intents
- [ ] Humans review, modify, and explicitly approve suggestions
- [ ] Suggestion audit trail in event store

### 13.3 — Reconciliation Triage

- [ ] Suggest probable causes (timing delay, fee delta, partial fill)
- [ ] Surface relevant historical resolutions

### 13.4 — Natural Language Queries

- [ ] "What was the total payroll distribution for Q4?"
- [ ] Translate natural language to reconciler/ledger/vault queries

---

## Phase 14 — User Interfaces

**Goal:** Make Attestia accessible to non-developers. The internals are event-sourced and API-driven by this point — UIs are thin consumers.

### 14.1 — Personal Vault UI

- [ ] Framework: Next.js or SvelteKit
- [ ] Multi-chain portfolio dashboard (read-only observation)
- [ ] Envelope budget management
- [ ] Intent declaration and approval workflow

### 15.1 — npm Publishing

- [ ] Publish all `@attestia/*` packages to npm
- [ ] Semantic versioning with conventional commits
- [ ] Changesets for coordinated multi-package releases

- [x] Docker Compose: attestia-node + rippled (full local stack)
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile for `@attestia/node`
- [ ] `attestia/observer` image — chain observer as a standalone service

### 15.3 — Documentation Site

- [ ] API reference (auto-generated from TypeScript + OpenAPI)
- [ ] Architecture guide (expanded from DESIGN.md)
- [ ] Tutorial: "Attest your first financial event"
- [ ] Tutorial: "Set up a multi-chain treasury"

## Principles (Unchanged)

These hold at every phase:

1. **Humans approve; machines verify.** No AI or automation ever approves, signs, or executes.
2. **Append-only.** No UPDATE, no DELETE. Only new entries.
3. **Fail-closed.** Disagreement halts the system. Never heals silently.
4. **Deterministic replay.** Same events → same state. Always.
5. **Chains are witnesses, not authorities.** XRPL attests. Authority flows from structural rules.
6. **Zero deps on the critical path.** External libraries only at the edges (chain SDKs, HTTP frameworks).
