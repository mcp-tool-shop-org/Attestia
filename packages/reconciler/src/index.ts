/**
 * @attestia/reconciler — Cross-system reconciliation engine.
 *
 * Matches and verifies financial records across three systems:
 * - Vault intents (what was planned/executed)
 * - Ledger entries (the accounting truth)
 * - On-chain events (the blockchain truth)
 *
 * Three matching dimensions:
 * 1. Intent ↔ Ledger — did the accounting reflect the intent?
 * 2. Ledger ↔ Chain — does the accounting match the blockchain?
 * 3. Intent ↔ Chain — does execution match what was planned?
 *
 * Reconciliation results are attested through Registrum for immutable audit trail.
