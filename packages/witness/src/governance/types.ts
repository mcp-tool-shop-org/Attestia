/**
 * Multi-Sig Witness Governance Types
 *
 * Event-sourced governance state for N-of-M multi-signature witnessing.
 * All mutations are captured as events for deterministic replay.
 *
 * Design:
 * - All types are readonly
 * - Event-sourced: state is derived from replaying events
 * - Quorum model: M-of-N (M required signatures out of N total signers)
