/**
 * @attestia/witness — XRPL attestation pipeline.
 *
 * Writes reconciliation proofs on-chain as XRPL payment memos.
 * Each attestation is a 1-drop self-send transaction with a content-addressed
 * memo payload, creating an immutable, timestamped proof on the XRP Ledger.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 * 1. Build payload — SHA-256 content-addressed attestation data
 * 2. Encode memo — XRPL transaction memo format (hex-encoded JSON)
 * 3. Submit — 1-drop self-send Payment with memo
 * 4. Verify — Read back from XRPL and verify integrity
 *
 * No smart contracts. No Turing-complete execution. Just timestamped proof.
