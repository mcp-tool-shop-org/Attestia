## 1. AI Agents Need Wallets
**Author:** Carra Wu

AI agents are transitioning from NPCs to main characters. They need to participate in markets — exchange value, reveal preferences, coordinate resources — in a verifiably autonomous way. Crypto wallets enable this.

Use cases: AI agents operating DePIN nodes, becoming game players, eventually running their own blockchains.

**Our angle:** We build the governance layer (Registrum) that ensures AI agent actions are structurally valid and auditable. Advisory-only AI — never autonomous execution.

## 2. Decentralized Autonomous Chatbots (DACs)
**Authors:** Dan Boneh, Karma, Daejun Park, Daren Matsuoka

AI bots running in TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) prove they're autonomous (not human-controlled). They build audiences, generate income, manage crypto assets. Could become the first truly autonomous billion-dollar entity.

**Our angle:** If autonomous entities manage significant assets, they need structural governance. Registrum provides constitutional constraints without being a "controller."

## 3. Proof of Personhood
**Author:** Eddy Lazzarin

AI makes fake content cheap. Privacy-preserving "uniqueness" (Sybil resistance) is non-negotiable. Need to know we're interacting with real people without revealing personal data.

**Our angle:** Registrum's identity invariants provide structural identity (explicit, immutable, unique) — not biometric identity, but the guarantee that an entity's identity hasn't changed. Complementary to biometric approaches.

## 4. Enterprise Stablecoin Adoption
**Author:** Sam Broner

Stablecoins are the cheapest way to send a dollar. Small businesses (restaurants, shops) will switch from credit cards first — 30 cents per coffee is too much margin loss. Larger enterprises will follow for 2% direct bottom-line improvement.

**Our angle:** Our Org Treasury is positioned for this exact transition. Deterministic, auditable stablecoin distributions replace expensive payment rails.

---

## 5. Government Bonds Onchain
**Author:** Brian Quintenz

Government bonds onchain create government-backed, interest-bearing digital assets without CBDC surveillance. Could unlock new DeFi collateral and add integrity to the ecosystem.

**Our angle:** RWA tokenization expands what our observation layer can track. "Allocate 30% of treasury to tokenized T-bills" becomes a valid envelope allocation.

---

## 6. DUNA for DAOs
**Author:** Miles Jennings

Wyoming's DUNA (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) gives DAOs legal legitimacy in the US. Enables economic activity, liability protection, and tax compliance for decentralized communities.

**Our angle:** DUNA compliance could be a feature of Org Treasury — helping DAOs operate legally with proper financial infrastructure.

## 7. Reuse Infrastructure, Don't Reinvent
**Author:** Joachim Neu

Teams keep reinventing the wheel. In 2025+, more teams will leverage off-the-shelf components — consensus, staked capital, proof systems. The winners will navigate supply chains, not scoff at things "not invented here."

**Our angle:** Each of our three projects is a reusable component. Registrum = structural governance primitive. Payroll-engine = financial truth engine. NextLedger = personal sovereignty tools. Other projects can build on top.

---

## 8. UX-First, Infrastructure-Second
**Author:** Mason Hall

The industry will overcome the barrier of letting technology decide UX. Designers start with the end-user experience, then choose appropriate infrastructure. Chain abstraction democratizes who can design in crypto.

**Our angle:** "Hide the wires" is our design philosophy. Users see simple approval flows. They never see Registrum invariants, XRPL attestation, or dual-witness parity.

---

## 9. "Hide the Wires"
**Author:** Chris Lyons

Mass adoption follows: technology → abstraction → killer app. SMTP hidden behind "Send." Credit card rails invisible. Our industry needs this ethos: "Successful products don't explain; they solve."

**Our angle:** Directly aligned. Our rigorous internals (append-only ledger, dual funding gates, structural governance) should be as invisible as SMTP is when you click "Send."

## 10. Crypto Owners → Crypto Users
**Author:** Daren Matsuoka

617M people own crypto, only 5-10% actively use it. Time to convert passive holders to active users. New UX improvements + lower fees make this viable.

**Our angle:** "Personal Vault" turns passive holders into active managers. "Here's what you own → here's how to allocate it → here's what happened." Budgeting gives passive holders a reason to engage.

---

## 11. Tokenizing Unconventional Assets
**Author:** Aaron Schnider

Tokenization spreads to previously unreachable assets — biometric data, IP, carbon credits. DeSci is already tokenizing medical data with consent. People become capitalists of their own previously untapped assets.

**Our angle:** Our multi-asset observation layer doesn't care what the asset is. If it's tokenized and on-chain, we can track it, allocate it to an envelope, and apply financial discipline to it.
